  <h1 class="alpha">Wrap-Up and Coverage for Düsseldorf 2019</h1>

  <div class="grid grid-wide">

    <div class="grid-item grid-item-two-thirds text blog-post">
      <p>Where do I start? I mean, I run this event for nearly ten years now. Every time you think <em>”That’s it. It can’t get any better”</em> and then you end the show and read, listen to and see all this wonderful and nice feedback. <strong>Wow</strong>, just incredible and fills me with a very warm and lovely feeling. Surely I am feeling exhausted. Empty. Tired. But the positive energy predominates. Energy that comes from people saying that they met many new friends, had exciting conversations and that my little event might have changed their life, or, at least, how they look at their day to day jobs and how they work. </p>
<p>When I started beyond tellerrand, I never would have thought, that my event would have an impact for anyone. Honestly. I wanted to create a friendly and inspiring event, where people would feel welcome and spend two days with nice people. Two days, where they maybe could escape the daily routines and hectic. Two days, where phones and/or laptops mostly stay in their pockets and bags. Well, and now? I honestly feel like in a dream somehow. <strong>Thank you so, so much!</strong></p>
<p>With this wrap-up post, I want to give anyone who has been at the event a chance to look at everything that happened again as well as having a source for those who could not be there to watch all the videos, see blog posts by other people from the event and have a look at the many photos that had been taken. As usual I am going to update this blog post with new material as long as I find it or as long as people send stuff to me. If you have or find anything related to this event, that is not listed already, <a href="mailto:marc@beyondtellerrand.com">please let me know</a>. Thanks.</p>

<h2>Stats and Facts</h2>
<p>What I have recognised this year is, that many more people started using <a href="https://instagram.com/btconf/">Instagram</a> to document and talk about the event. Even though 2389 tweets had been made with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=btconf">#btconf</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/btconf">Twitter</a>, I had the feeling that more and more people use Instagram.</p>
<p>Interesting also: we had less people using the wifi than ever before. Maybe also because people were following the talks more intensively.</p>
<p>This year we had people from <del>24</del> 26 countries in the house. Those countries, from A–Z, were: Argentina, Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Gambia, Germany, Greece, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States. Wow. </p>
<figure class="blog-img-full"><img alt="Photo showing me, thanking all volunteers at the end of the show." src="https://beyondtellerrand.com/media/pages/blog/wrap-up-dusseldorf-2019/1786779587-1566250576/volunteers.jpg"><figcaption>Thanks to the volunteer-team.

<p><strong>14 wonderful volunteers</strong> were amongst those people. The core team is coming back for many, many years already and the names of those who helped running the event are: <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/xandrucea">Alex</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ixisio">Andreas</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/retinafunk">Andy</a>, Bartek, <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielaValero_">Daniela</a>, Ewa, Jana, <a href="https://twitter.com/Jessman5">Jessica</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Luzifuchs">Lisa</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/poke">Patrick</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheTalesOfImmo">Sven</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tomloake">Tom</a></strong> with <strong>Tanja (my lovely wife) and <a href="https://twitter.com/phlegpallium">Guido</a></strong> leading the team. Absolutely fantastic to have such a stunning team. Thanks a lot!</p>
<h2>Side Events Before and After</h2>
<p>On Saturday 11th and Sunday 12th, we already and as usual for the last five years met for the <a href="https://indieweb.org/2019/D%C3%BCsseldorf">IndieWebCamp</a> in Düsseldorf. <a href="http://tantek.com">Tantek</a> and I organised this IWC and it once more was hosted by our friends at <a href="https://sipgate.de">sipgate</a>. </p>
<figure class="blog-img-full"><img alt="A photo showing the opening session at the Indie Web Camp in Düsseldorf with speakers and attendees." src="https://beyondtellerrand.com/media/pages/blog/wrap-up-dusseldorf-2019/3933515359-1566250575/indiewebcamp-dusseldorf.jpg"><figcaption>Indie Web Camp no. 5 in Düsseldorf at sipgate.

<p>For the very first time our friends at <a href="https://www.wacom.com/en-gb/">Wacom</a> hosted our Pre-Conference Warm-Up. All 200 tickets were taken and Wacom did an amazingly wonderful job of creating a friendly environment for us to meet and greet at the evening before beyond tellerrand. Wacom gave us a home and too care of us with drink, snacks and a DJ. <strong>Thank you so much!</strong></p>
<p>We furthermore had four sessions between the regular schedule: a Breakfast Session with Liam Griffin for <a href="https://shopify.com">Shopify</a>, one Lunch-Time Session by Christoph Reinartz for <a href="https://tech.tivago.com">trivago</a>, another Lunch-Time Session with Chris Heilmann and the Working Draft Podcast for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, and an Evening-Break Session with Fabien Benetou for <a href="https://mozilla.com">Mozilla</a>. Thanks everybody for the session!</p>
<p><a href="https://jkphl.is">Joschi Kuphal</a> organised another <a href="https://accessibility-club.org/">Accessibility Club</a> around beyond tellerrand. The first one in Düsseldorf and smaller than his conference in Berlin, but with around 70 attendees a well attended one with presentations and bar camp like sessions during the whole day.</p>
<h2>Photos</h2>
<p>This year <strong><a href="https://normanposselt.com">Norman Posselt</a></strong>, <a href="https://florianziegler.de">Florian Ziegler</a>, <a href="https://julieannenoying.com/">Juliane Schütz</a> and <a href="http://dantz.me">Andreas Dantz</a> <em>officially</em> took photos at the event, but other people shot some amazing photos as well. Anything I got or found so far is listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://florianziegler.de">Florian Ziegler</a></strong> was part of the beyond tellerrand family again and captured the atmosphere in lovely <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/damndirty/albums/72157705143805622">black and white photos</a> during the days.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://julieannenoying.com/">Juliane Schütz</a></strong> comes to Düsseldorf for a while now. Always known for amazing photos at the Indie Web Camp as well as beyond tellerrand, she caught this year’s edition in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sickonsunday/sets/72157691522720683/with/46973139405/">a mix of black and white as well as color shots</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://dantz.me">Andreas Dantz</a></strong> captured the show on stage and in the exhibition in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/szene/sets/72157708612797814/">this great set of photos</a>.</li>
<li>Long time friend and supporter with sipgate <strong>Axel Topeters</strong>  created <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/topeters-fotografie/sets/72157691518158463/">this set of lovely photos</a> from two days in Düsseldorf.</li>
<li><strong>Juliane Schütz</strong> also created photo sets of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tollwerk/sets/72157691376106913/">day 1</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tollwerk/sets/72157708390735855">day 2</a> at the Indie Web Camp for us.</li>
<li>If you want to see how the atmosphere at the Accessibility Club has been, follow <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tollwerk/sets/72157708482093205/">this batch of photos</a> by <strong>tollwerk</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you search for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/btconf/">btconf on Instagram</a> you also find a lot of photos. Sadly I am too stupid to sort them chronological (is there a way?).</p>
<figure class="blog-img-full"><img alt="This image shows a series of portrait photos of Mike Hill taken by Norman Posselt." src="https://beyondtellerrand.com/media/pages/blog/wrap-up-dusseldorf-2019/765268828-1566250576/mike-hill-collage.jpg"><figcaption>As first example of the wonderful speaker portraits you see Mike Hill’s pictures. Photos: Norman Posselt.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next to this <a href="https://normanposselt.com">Norman Posselt</a> took portraits of each speaker after their talks. They are not available yet, but as soon as they are, I am going to link to them.</p>
<p>It is hugely important to have photos of many people. They not only help to bring back memories, but also show the different view on the event, that each photographer has. I love seeing people interact, laugh, have fun, and exchange. If you took any photos, please let me know and I will happily add them.</p>
<h2>Videos &amp; Transcriptions</h2>
<p>We have got a <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/beyondtellerrand/">Vimeo</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/btconf/">YouTube</a> channel to host all our talks.

<p>All the people listed below made the effort to sit down and write something about beyond tellerrand. This means so much to me. Not only as it is quite some work and needs time to do this, but also as it is fantastic that they tell other people about the event. Thanks so much to everybody who has written something about beyond tellerrand Düsseldorf 2019:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://robert.katzki.de">Robert Katzki</a> has written <a href="https://robert.katzki.de/posts/beyond-tellerrand-2019-duesseldorf">his personal view on this year’s edition</a>. He summarises his favourite talks spiced up with a few photos. Thanks Robert!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not a write-up, but <a href="https://tobiastom.name">Tobias Tom</a> has written <a href="https://tobiastom.name/articles/digital-loneliness">a little piece on <em>“Digital Loneliness”</em></a> when he was waiting for his flight back from Düsseldorf. And he is right, when his call to action after beyond tellerrand is <em>”Let’s fill the internet with life”</em> ;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://francescoschwarz.com">Francesco Schwarz</a> has created <a href="https://francescoschwarz.com/blog/beyond-tellerrand-2019-duesseldorf/">a very detailed summary</a> of talks and things around the main schedule. Including Warm-Up, the guest appearance of Lord Mayor of Düsseldorf Thomas Geisel and Lunch-Time Sessions. Thank you!</p>

<li>
<p>In <a href="https://responsivedesign.is/articles/beyond-tellerrand-2019/">this article</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/justinavery">Justin Avery</a> started to write his personal wrap-up post. He also mentions his post-event feeling, which I use to call post-conference-blues ;) Thanks Justing for <a href="https://responsivedesign.is/articles/beyond-tellerrand-2019/">the write-up</a>. Looking forward to seeing the full article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/danielavalero_">Daniela Valero</a> organised a CfP Global Diversity Day earlier this year on which I had to pleasure to lead everyone through the day and give a short presentation. Now she wanted to be part of the volunteer team in Düsseldorf and <a href="https://medium.com/@danielavalero/bt-conf-dus-2019-as-a-volunteer-my-notes-of-the-talks-499e5d7e574b">has written about her experience, attending and helping at the event</a>. Part of her write-up is a detailed summary of the <em>”Ask me anything”</em> session with Microsoft about the future of the Edge browser. Thanks for your help and the article, Daniela!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also not really a write-up, but as a conclusion of having been at this year’s beyond tellerrand, <a href="https://bastianallgeier.com">Bastian Allgeier</a> has <a href="https://bastianallgeier.com/notes/back-from-the-dead">brought his personal blog back to life</a>. Yay for that!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.webrocker.de">Tom Arnold</a> has written a few things about 2019’s <em>btconf</em>. First of <a href="https://www.webrocker.de/2019/05/16/take-back-your-web-tantek-celik-beyond-tellerrand-conference-duesseldorf-2019/">he has picked Tantek’s talk</a> called <em>”Take Back Your Web”</em> to use this as call to action. Then he mentions <a href="https://www.webrocker.de/2019/05/14/the-power-of-metaphor-mike-hill-beyond-tellerrand-conference-duesseldorf-2019/">Mike’s talk</a> (thanks for your kind words, Tom). Last but not least <a href="https://www.webrocker.de/2019/05/15/beyond-tellerrand-duesseldorf-2019/">he summarised the whole event including other talks in a post</a> as well. I reckon Tom has no idea what it means to me, when he writes the following, but thanks so, so much for this, Tom!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you Marc for doing this. Little did I know nine years ago how many friendships I would find through this event and how much I become reliant of this space where I feel part of a tribe, of not being alone in this constant struggle between (creative) longing and (economic) necessities and resisting the call of the centre of the comfort zone.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bkastl.de">Bianca Kastl</a>, also one of the long-time attendees, has written a <a href="https://bkastl.de/notes/curiosity-beyond-tellerrand-btconf-dus-2019">German</a> and <a href="https://bkastl.de/en/notes/curiosity-beyond-tellerrand-btconf-dus-2019">English</a> summary with personal note about beyond tellerrand Düsseldorf 2019. She also writes the following, which makes me truly happy:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I left Düsseldorf with my head full of thoughts, inspiration, conversations and fun with some old friends, met interesting new people and had a very good time there.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My good friend <a href="http://brendandawes.com">Brendan Dawes</a> has written <a href="http://brendandawes.com/projects/beyondtellerrand2019">a short article</a> about the opening titles and assets, which he created for this event (see below). Thanks Bren!</p>

<p><a href="http://robdraper.co.uk">Rob Draper</a>, one of the speakers this year and responsible for the t-shirt design and many of this year’s assets look and feel, has written a blog post about his experience at the show. It means a lot, that he says this about the event and the audience:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So pulling it all together, can completely see now why the event was so popular, Marcs passion is everywhere and its not hard to see why the event is so popular, I now feel like one of that family and I'll definitely be back.</p>

<p><a href="https://adactio.com">Jeremy Keith</a> has been to quite a few of my events now. It always is a great pleasure to have him on board. Speaking, attending and/or helping with Side Events like the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWebCamp</a>. He has <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/15216">written about his impressions of las week’s beyond tellerrand</a> and I happy – and a bit proud – that he says this about beyond tellerrand (thank you Jeremy!):</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Marc somehow manages to curate a line-up that’s equal parts creativity and code; design and development. It shouldn’t work, but it does. I love the fact that he had a legend of the industry like David Carson on the same stage as first-time speaker like Dorobot …and the crowd loved ‘em equally!</p>

<p>It was the first time for <a href="https://matthias.beitl.net/">Matthias Beitl</a> to attend beyond tellerrand and he has written me a lovely email with nice feedback and pointed to his <a href="https://cssence.com/about/2019-05-beyond-tellerrand">blog post about the 2019 Düsseldorf show</a> at <a href="https://cssence.com">cssence</a>. He has written about his favourite talks, but also about the Break Sessions of trivago, Microsoft and Mozilla. Nice to hear, that they are relevant to people. Thanks for the time to write this, Matthias!</p>

<h2>T-Shirts, Event-Theme and Assets</h2>
<figure class="blog-img-full"><img alt="Three photos showing the stage. One of them with me and a big “thanks” that Rob created, one with Rob speaking and one with the t-shirt design stating “Stay Curious”" src="https://beyondtellerrand.com/media/pages/blog/wrap-up-dusseldorf-2019/2264392967-1566250576/t-shirt-rob.jpg"><figcaption>Rob created some great assets to work with and this year’s t-shirt design.

<p>The wonderful <a href="http://robdraper.co.uk">Rob Draper</a>, also a speaker of this edition, has agreed to create the t-shirt design for Düsseldorf 2019. When I asked him, it was an instant <em>Yes!</em> and I got so many great drafts more or less immediately. </p>
<p>Inspired by a talk of <a href="http://davidjdelgado.com">David Delgado</a> who has given the evening talk at this edition, I have chosen a phrase that Rob then put into a lovely design. “Stay Curious” was what we had chosen and I really, really <strong>love</strong> the t-shirt. Thanks so much Rob!</p>
<h2>Opening Titles</h2>
<figure class="blog-img-full"><a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/5984222/video/336343651"><img alt="Screenshot of this year’s opening titles showing a wave and the name of the event in big letters" src="https://beyondtellerrand.com/media/pages/blog/wrap-up-dusseldorf-2019/1299395895-1566250576/opening-titles.jpg"></a><figcaption>Beautiful titles by Brendan Dawes.</figcaption></figure>
<p>As stated earlier my friend <strong><a href="http://brendandawes.com">Brendan Dawes</a></strong> created this year’s opening titles for Düsseldorf. He contacted me a while ago and asked, if anyone already would be doing the titles. I said no and he started thinking about it. Brendan created interference patterns with the help of Houdini and created a beautiful piece of work to open the event with. He has written <a href="http://brendandawes.com/projects/beyondtellerrand2019">a short post</a> about what he used and what the idea behind the movie is.</p>
<p>Next to the titles, he created 15 <a href="https://twitter.com/brendandawes/status/1128572989686022144">A1 posters</a> for the speakers and the event which covered the whole entrance area. He sent a set of rendered files as well for me to create all the assets for the event in a similar look and feel, like <a href="https://twitter.com/g16n/status/1127864687826280448">the price panels at the bars</a>, animations for the exhibition, the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/szene/33985724028/in/dateposted/">slides for the stage</a> and much more.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for this, Brendan. Simply beautiful.</p>

<h2>Audio Design</h2>
<figure class="blog-img-full"><a href="https://baldower.de"><img alt="A set of three photos montaged into one with Tobi while playing live music" src="https://beyondtellerrand.com/media/pages/blog/wrap-up-dusseldorf-2019/412933268-1566250576/tobi.jpg"></a><figcaption>Energised Tobi Lessnow aka Baldower.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In 2013 <strong><a href="http://tobi-lessnow.com">Tobi Lessnow</a></strong> (aka <a href="http://baldower.de">Baldower</a>) came to me with the idea of doing <em>Audio Sketchnotes</em> and he still is doing them and is part of the event as much as the speakers are. Tobi exclusively created another title song named <em>”We Are The Electronic Community”</em> for the show and brought many new tracks. He sampled the speakers and created tracks for each of the speakers right after their talks. Great idea, still working perfectly for beyond tellerrand and – most importantly – with Tobi. Thanks you, Tobi, for being part of the family!</p>
<h2>Live Captions</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/stenomanuk">Andrew</a>, sitting in Scotland, did an amazing job and live captioned all 13 talks. A direct audio connection sent the audio of all talks to him and he live captioned every word or the event that was spoken on stage. Thank you, Andrew!</p>
<h2>A Documentary</h2>
<p><a href="http://stn1978.com">Stefan Nitzsche</a> and Andreas Brüggemann started to work on a documentary about beyond tellerrand a couple of months ago. This was the first of three cities we are going to cover (next to Munich and Berlin) and where we recorded material onsite the event. The outcome was a first trailer for the documentary, <a href="https://beyondtellerrand.com/blog/beyond-tellerrand-a-documentary">as announced here also</a>. Of course I’d be happy, also in the name of Stefan and Andreas, if you spread it, if you like it.</p>

<p>Next to all the things that I have written, I am delighted that the Lord Mayor of Düsseldorf, <a href="https://twitter.com/OB_ThomasGeisel">Thomas Geisel</a>, visited us on Monday to welcome the audience to Düsseldorf and show his appreciation. Thanks you!</p>

<p>This is all that I have and found up to now. Please help me and <a href="marc@beyondtellerrand.com">send anything you know of</a>, what you find or what you have written or created about and since beyond tellerrand in Düsseldorf. This is a living archive of what happened in Düsseldorf at beyond tellerrand and what made me – and hopefully many of you – happy. Thanks a lot!</p>
<p><strong>The next stop of beyond tellerrand is <a href="https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2019">Berlin</a>. Usually tickets would be on sale, but I still need to clarify a venue first. Feel free to join my <a href="https://beyondtellerrand.com/newsletter">newsletter</a> to stay up to date.</strong> </p>
<p>Thank you once more for an unbelievable and wonderful time in Düsseldorf with a lot of memorable experiences and conversations. I hope to see you soon again!</p>
